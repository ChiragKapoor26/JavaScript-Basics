/*
The key Difference between the var and let datatypes is as follows:-
the var is functional scope variable and let is Block Scope Variable

Matlab Agar kise ke aage let likha hai toh uski value Change Bhi ho Sakti hai or Vo ek block scope
matlab {}iske andar hi defined hai agar var assigned hai toh vo puri file mai globally defined hai
